# Community of Agents

Community of Agents is a Python-based project that creates a command-line interactive system where AI agents interact with the user. Each agent has its own personality, maintains a conversation history, and can execute built-in tools (such as fetching the current time) when needed.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- **Create and Manage AI Agents:** Each agent has a personality, conversation history, and a toolbox of functions (tools) it can use.
- **Integrate Tools:** Agents can use tools (for example, `TimeKeeper`) to answer questions or perform specific tasks when they don't have a direct answer.
- **Interact via a Command Line Interface:** Users can load agents, send messages, view agent details, and check conversation history using simple commands.
- **Maintain a Conversation History:** Agents remember past interactions to provide context for future responses.
- **Handle and Parse JSON Responses:** The system is designed to extract and parse JSON responses even when they are wrapped in markdown formatting.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Engage with AI agents in real-time.
- **Toolbox Integration:** Automatically uses tools when needed.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Uses Pythonâ€™s `logging` module for helpful debug messages.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily add new tools or agent types.
- **Command-Based Control:** Commands to load agents, list available agents, display details, and more.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CommunityOfAgents.git
   cd CommunityOfAgents

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Usage:**
To start the application, run:
    ```bash
    python COA.py
    You will see a prompt (#>) where you can enter commands.

5. **Available Commands:**
    ```bash

    !help
    Displays a list of available commands.

    !quit
    Exits the application.

6. **Example Interaction:**
    Load an Agent:

    ```bash
    #> !agent load 1
    Agent Rebecca added.

7.  **Start a Conversation:**
    ```bash
    #> hello
    <Rebecca>: {"tool_choice": "no tool", "tool_input": "Hello there! How can I assist you today  "} ...
8. **Ask a Tool-Based Question:**
    ```bash
    #> what time is it?
    <Rebecca>: {"tool_choice": "TimeKeeper", "tool_input": null} ...

9. **Code Structure:**
    COA.py:
    Main script that contains the command line interface and core logic for agent interactions.

    agents/agents.py:
    Contains agent definitions (e.g., AGENT_REBECCA and AGENT_JOHN).

    tools/time_keeper.py:
    Contains the TimeKeeper function used by agents.
